It is interesting to see how much my design looks similar to my inital design plan, but then how much it ended up veering off as I worked on it. The surprise of the Contact Page got me as I missed it in the intial information, which is why that page was not planned. Ended up taking that footer off and putting that basically on its own page.

Thank you for teaching us this semester, and I'm looking forward to the next class in the Spring!
