                <h2>Historian & Educator</h2>
                <p>I earned a Bachelor of Arts from Middle Tennessee State University in history, with a secondary focus
                    in Classical Studies. For my Master's, I focused on Antebellum American History with a secondary
                    focus on European Medieval History. My current research and focus is on American immigration history
                    and the development of American
                    Government. Click <a href="education.html">here</a> for more information.</p>
                <p>With the knowledge I gained from my schooling and research, I decided I wanted to pass along this
                    knowledge to others. One of the best things is to see the click in my
                    student's eyes when they finally understand the subject matter, often making personal connections to
                    the information. I am certified to teach in Missouri and Tennessee
                    at the high school and middle school levels in Social Studies and English at the high school leve.
                </p>
                <p>Most of my teaching experience has been focused on higher education, teaching history, government,
                    college success, and tutoring. Click <a href="jobexperience.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

                <h2>Web Developer</h2>
                <p>Over the summer, I decided that I wanted to expand my knowledge base. To do this, I decided to get my
                    web designer certification to learn about building websites. I have a lot of ideas of how I want to
                    use this knowledge, but one of the main ideas I float back to is building a website that focuses on
                    history, genealogy, or something in a similar vein.</p>
